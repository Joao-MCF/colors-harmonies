# Harmonies Colors

## Getting started
Simple project to generate color harmonies from [color theory](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-theory-design) using a main color as a basis.

## Color schemes
### Monochromatic
 - Monochromatic color schemes use a single color with varying shades and tints to produce a consistent look and feel.

### Analogous
 - Analogous color schemes are formed by pairing one main color with the two colors directly next to it on the color wheel.

### Complementary
- Complementary color scheme is based on the use of two colors directly across from each other on the color wheel and relevant tints of those colors.

### Split complementary
 - A split complementary scheme includes one dominant color and the two colors directly adjacent to the dominant color's complement.

### Triadic
 - Triadic color schemes are created by choosing three colors that are equally placed in lines around the color wheel

### Tetradicic
 - The tetradicic color scheme uses four colors equidistant from each other on the color wheel to create a square or diamond shape.
